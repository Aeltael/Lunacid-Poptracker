# Lunacid-Poptracker Guide
 The Lunacid poptracker pack for all your needs. Intended for use with the Lunacid Archipelago Randomizer.

 ## Requirements
- [Poptracker Version 0.25.8+ / 0.26.1+ for AP Support](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases)
- [Lunacid AP Randomizer](https://github.com/Witchybun/LunacidAPClient/releases)

## Install & Setup
If you just intend to just use the tracker and not set up the randomizer the process will be quick and simple. 
- Start off by downloading Poptracker and the latest version of this pack. 
- Once you've downloaded both, extract Poptracker somewhere you can easily access and find the folder "packs" inside.
- Extract the "Lunacid-Poptracker-x.x.x" folder into the "packs" folder and then run Poptracker.
- Click on the folder icon in the upper left, look for "Lunacid Pack" and select your variant. 
- If it doesn't show there then make sure that the "Lunacid-Poptracker-x.x.x" folder isn't nested i.e:

_**WRONG**_
- packs
    - "Lunacid-Poptracker-x.x.x" 
        - "Lunacid-Poptracker-x.x.x" 
            - pack files

_**RIGHT**_
- packs
    - "Lunacid-Poptracker-x.x.x"
        - pack files


If you intend to use the Archipelago Randomizer then head over to the [installation guide](https://github.com/Witchybun/LunacidAPClient/blob/main/Documentation/Setup.md) to setup the mod and generate a seed. 

To enable auto tracking click on the AP icon in the upper left area, enter the Archipelago host and port, the Player Name and finally a password if you need one.
